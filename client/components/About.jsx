<p>Tēnā koutou katoa,
  I te taha Whatukura he uri nā Hineamaru i ngā rekereke o Ngati Hine.

  Ko Brooklyn Lyndon-Tonga ahau. </p>
  
  <p>Kia ora,I’m Brooklyn Lyndon-Tonga, the founder, web developer, and creative force behind Haeata Media.
    As a proud Māori and passionate advocate for all things Māori, I created this business to help people like myself build meaningful online spaces that celebrate our values and identity.

While I’m a one-person operation, I’m far from working alone. I have a trusted network of designers, content creators, and tech specialists I can call on to bring our vision to life.
Whether it’s crafting beautiful designs, writing compelling content, or tackling technical challenges, I ensure that our project has all that it needs.

At Haeata Media, I focus on weaving together storytelling, te ao Māori, and innovative web design to create websites that feel personal and powerful.
Let’s work together to build something unique, authentic, and meaningful.</p>
